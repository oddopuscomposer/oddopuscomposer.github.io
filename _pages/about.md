Salutations I am Alix, an eruditic artist who explores quirky game development, composes wonky lyrical indie rock, and pontificates on various nerdery via adventuring through possessed hyper-focused research and practical experiments.
Come join me as I build nifty games, write queer tunes, craft quirky tutorials, and share the wonky and interesting tidbits I come across.
